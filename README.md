Recommender System's project

In this project I had to make some recommendations to a set of users, stating from a URM.

I have approached the problem using two different algorithms: RP3beta and SLIM ElasticNet, and constructing an hybrid algorithm.

I have tuned the hyperparameters using a K-Fold Cross Validation and Optuna bayesian search. To improve the tuning, I have parallelized the CV.
